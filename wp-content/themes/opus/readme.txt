# Opus Theme

For a long time, I always want to craft a theme with these three goals in mind: 

1. It should have great reading experience.
2. It should look great on mobile or tablet.
3. It should have personality.

With these three main goals, I started designing and developing Opus Theme. 

## O, Reading Experience!
For the initial main color scheme and design elements, I found Designmodo's Square UI kit to be suitable for the design direction. Its use of Montserrat inspired me with big bold fonts and spacious elements. Open sans feels matched with the overall concept too, so she is joining the Opus theme. Thanks for Google Webfonts for providing these great fonts for free.

As much as my aspiration for great reading experience, great writing experience is important too. The editor's styling has been tweaked to display the content as similar as possible with how the content is displayed on the front page.

## Looks Great on Every Screen
I often blog-walk using my iPhone and i found that many desktop oriented themes are not pleasurable to be read using mobile screen. Zooming in and out to read content is annoying. Hence, Opus theme is designed with mobile first approach. The default layout for Opus is a fluid layout which will be switched to fixed layout with spacious whitespace when it is opened on larger than 680 pixels. I neat javascript based trick is employed to adjust your image and embedded media to the layout displayed.

## Personality Matters
I want opus to facilitate self expression of its users. To enable this, big image slash page cover design element is implemented on Opus. Go snap big and pretty image, it'll have its space on Opus through WordPress' native custom header and featured image. I always feel that the color scheme of the site shows the personality of the site as much as page cover, so Opus  utilizes WordPress customizer API so you can have Opus powered site with various colors.
